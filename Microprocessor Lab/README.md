# Microprocessor Laboratory

This directory contains the complete record of experiments performed as part of the **Microprocessor Laboratory (CSL502)** course. Each experiment focuses on a specific aspect of the Intel 8086 microprocessor, implemented primarily in Assembly Language.

## Laboratory Overview

The practical component is designed to provide hands-on experience with:
- 8086 Instruction Set and Architecture.
- Data manipulation and arithmetic operations.
- Control flow, loops, and decision-making in Assembly.
- String handling and system services.
- Interfacing with C for higher-level logic.
