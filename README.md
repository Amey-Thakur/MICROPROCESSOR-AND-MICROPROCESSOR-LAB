                                     OVERVIEW SECTION
     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Microprocessor (CSC501) and Microprocessor Lab (CSL501) are core subjects in the Third Year (Semester V) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. These courses provide foundational knowledge of the 8086 microprocessor architecture, its instruction set, peripheral interfacing, and the principles of low-level system programming.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key domains in microprocessor systems:

- **8086 Architecture**: Internal architecture, memory segmentation, register organization, and signal descriptions.
- **Instruction Set**: Data transfer, arithmetic, logical, string manipulation, and processor control instructions.
- **Assembly Language Programming**: Writing and debugging 8086 programs using TASM/MASM.
- **System Interfacing**: Designing memory and I/O interfaces, interrupt controllers (8259), and programmable peripheral interfaces (8255).
- **Advanced Architecture**: Introduction to 80386, 80486, and Pentium processors.
- **Multiprocessor Configurations**: Coprocessor configurations and closely/loosely coupled systems.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, lab experiments, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As a computer engineer, understanding the underlying hardware-software interface is crucial for low-level system design, embedded systems, and performance optimization. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental microprocessor concepts.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through MP and MP Lab.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.
